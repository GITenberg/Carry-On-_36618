England's flag so long adored<BR>

  THE YOUNG KNIGHTS
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now they remain to us forever young<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who with such splendor gave their youth away;<BR>
Perpetual Spring is their inheritance,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though they have lived in Flanders and in France<BR>
A round of years, in one remembered day.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
They drained life's goblet as a joyous draught<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left within the cup no bitter lees.<BR>
Sweetly they answered to the King's behest,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gallantly fared forth upon a quest,<BR>
Beset by foes on land and on the seas.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So in the ancient world hath bloomed again<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rose of old romance&mdash;red as of yore;<BR>
The flower of high emprise hath whitely blown<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the graves of those we call our own,<BR>
And we will know its fragrance evermore.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now if their deeds were written with the stars,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In golden letters on the midnight sky<BR>
They would not care.  They were so young, and dear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They loved the best the things that were most near,<BR>
And gave no thought to glory far and high.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
They need no shafts of marble pure and cold&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No painted windows radiantly bright;<BR>
Across our hearts their names are carven deep&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In waking dreams, and in the dreams of sleep,<BR>
They bring us still ineffable delight.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Methinks heaven's gates swing open very wide<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To welcome in a host so fair and strong;<BR>
Perchance the unharmed angels as they sing,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May envy these the battle-scars they bring,<BR>
And sigh e'er they take up the triumph song!<BR>

  THE SHELLS
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
O my brave heart!  O my strong heart!  My sweet heart and gay,<BR>
The soul of me went with you the hour you marched away,<BR>
For surely she is soulless, this woman white, and still,<BR>
Who works with shining metal to make the things that kill.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I tremble as I touch them,&mdash;so strange they are, and bright;<BR>
Each one will be a comet to break the purple night.<BR>
Grey Fear will ride before it, and Death will ride behind,<BR>
The sound of it will deafen,&mdash;the light of it will blind!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And whom it meets in passing, but God alone will know;<BR>
Each one will blaze a trail in blood&mdash;will hew a road of woe;<BR>
O when the fear is on me, my heart grows faint and cold:&mdash;<BR>
I dare not think of what I do,&mdash;of what my fingers hold.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then sounds a Voice, "Arise, and make the weapons of the Lord!"<BR>
"He rides upon the whirlwind!  He hath need of shell and sword!<BR>
His army is a mighty host&mdash;the lovely and the strong,&mdash;<BR>
They follow Him to battle, with trumpet and with Song!"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
O my brave heart!  My strong heart!  My sweet heart and dear,&mdash;<BR>
'Tis not for me to falter,&mdash;'Tis not for me to fear&mdash;<BR>
Across the utmost barrier&mdash;wherever you may be,&mdash;<BR>
With joy unspent, and deathless, my soul will follow thee.<BR>

  THE WATCHER
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Little White Moon&mdash;Each night from Heaven you lean<BR>
To watch the lonely Seas, and all the Earth between;&mdash;<BR>
O little shining Moon!  What have you seen?&mdash;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
What have you seen upon the fields of France,<BR>
Where through the drowsy grain, the gay red poppies dance,<BR>
Unheeding splintered gun or broken lance?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Deep in the green-wood, shadow-laced, and still,<BR>
What is it you have found, by fern-bed and by rill?<BR>
What by each hollow&mdash;and each little hill?&mdash;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
When o'er the sky the driven smoke-clouds flee,<BR>
And through a dusky veil look down fearfully&mdash;<BR>
What do you find adrift upon the sea?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
In the great mountains where the four winds blow,&mdash;<BR>
Where the King's cavalry, and his foot-soldiers go&mdash;<BR>
What have you seen beneath the shifting snow?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Little white Moon!  So old,&mdash;so strangely bright&mdash;<BR>
How could you still shine on, unless you knew some night<BR>
Here in the world you watch, all would be right!<BR>

  OCTOBER GOES
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
October goes, and its colors all pass:<BR>
At dawn there's a silver film on the grass,<BR>
And the reeds are shining as pipes of glass,<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But yesterweek where the cloud waves rolled<BR>
Down a wind-swept sky that was grey, and cold,<BR>
Sailed the hunter's moon,&mdash;a galleon of gold!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And now in the very depth of the night<BR>
It is just a little flame, blown and white,<BR>
Or a broken-winged moth on a weary flight.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But the steadfast trees at the forest rim,<BR>
And the pines in places scented and dim,<BR>
Still wait for one hunter, and watch for him.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And the wind in the branches whispers, "Why?"<BR>
And the yellow leaves that go rustling by,<BR>
Say only, "Remember," and sigh,&mdash;and sigh.<BR>

  DREAMS
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Keep thou thy dreams&mdash;though joy should pass thee by;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold to the rainbow beauty of thy thought;<BR>
It is for dreams that men will oft-times die,&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And count the passing pain of death as nought.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Keep though thy dreams, though faith should faint and fail,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And time should loose thy fingers from the creeds,<BR>
The vision of the Christ will still avail<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lead thee on to truth and tender deeds.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Keep thou thy dreams all the winter's cold,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When weeds are withered, and the garden grey,<BR>
Dream thou of roses with their hearts of gold,&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckon to summers that are on their way.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Keep thou thy dreams&mdash;the tissue of all wings<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is woven first of them; from dreams are made<BR>
The precious and imperishable things,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose loveliness lives on, and does not fade.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Keep thou thy dreams, intangible and dear<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the blue ether of the utmost sky,&mdash;<BR>
A dream may lift thy spirit past all fear,<BR>

  BEFORE THE DAWN

<P CLASS="poem">
In that one darkest hour, before the dawn is here,<BR>
Each soul of us goes sailing, close to the coast of Fear.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
There in the windless quiet, from out the folded black,<BR>
The things we have forgotten&mdash;or would forget&mdash;come back.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Old sorrows, long abandoned, or kept with lock and key,<BR>
Steal from their prison places to bear us company.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
All softly come our little sins&mdash;our scarlet sins&mdash;and gray,<BR>
To keep with us a vigil till breaking of the day.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
And there are velvet footsteps; or oft we seem to hear<BR>
Light garments brush against the dark; so near&mdash;so very near!<BR>

Then heavily, as weighed by tears, each haunted moment goes,<BR>
For dawn steps down the morning sky, in robes of gray and rose.<BR>

O fairies of the forest-ring, and little men in green,<BR>

All your broken war-spent heroes,<BR>
Lord of War and Grief&mdash;you pay<BR>
With a cross of moulded iron,<BR>
Hard-wrought iron cold and grey.<BR>
On the Somme you grant five thousand<BR>
And five thousand at Verdun;<BR>
At the dawn of day you count them<BR>
And at setting of the sun.<BR>
On the trampled fields of Flanders,<BR>
On the bitter roads of France,<BR>
Where the big guns chant their war-songs,<BR>
And the crimson death-lights dance,<BR>
There you count the iron crosses<BR>
Of such high and far renown,&mdash;-<BR>
Grim and grey the men who win them&mdash;<BR>
Theirs the cross&mdash;and yours the crown;&mdash;<BR>

Not a cross shall be forgotten,&mdash;<BR>

So of weeping&mdash;no more;<BR>

Who can tell me&mdash;who knows,<BR>

  A WAR CHANT
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
O England!  Thy foe hath hated thee long,<BR>
And his hate is a deadly thing;<BR>
It was held in his heart till its growth was strong,<BR>
Now, words have woven it into a song<BR>
For little children to sing.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
It is hatred that fashioned his shot and shell,<BR>
And hatred hid death in the sea;<BR>
In hatred the cannon have sounded a knell<BR>
O'er the little homes where the peaceful dwell,<BR>
And the humble-hearted be.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thy foe hath swept the blue from the sky<BR>
In a fury of smoke and flame;<BR>
His guns are not stilled where the wounded lie,&mdash;<BR>
He hath shown no pity to those who die<BR>
For the glory of his name.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He sealed his hate with the blood of his men&mdash;<BR>
O, the young in their coats of grey!&mdash;<BR>
They are cast aside, and in river, and fen,<BR>
Deep-hidden, where none will find them again<BR>
Till the last white judgment day.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now mirth is forgotten and joy is dead;<BR>
The world hath accepted its pain;<BR>
Still, over old battlefields, newly red,<BR>
The shattered ranks of his army are led<BR>
In pomp and a high disdain.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thy anger grows slowly, for thou art great,<BR>
O England! thou well beloved land;<BR>
When its tide is full-risen, then thou art Fate,&mdash;<BR>

The sword of flame in his hand!<BR>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
